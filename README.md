Order of running (after 3 the order does not matter): 
1. EDA.ipynb :
2. Test.ipynb :
3. preprocessing.ipynb : this notebook was used to create csvs that contained preprocessed posts and bert_embeddins after undersampling.
4. Wordclouds.ipynb : This notebook produces wordcloud plots for a selected dichotomy.
5. Zeroshot.ipynb : This notebook is used to run the analysis on the test preprocessed data through DeBERTa.
6. bert.ipynb : this notebook was used to create functions such as preprocess_text and get_bert_embeddings. furthermore, neural network model was created, its parameters were tuned and the model evaluation was also done here.
7. logistic_reg.ipynb : 
8. svm.ipynb : this notebook was used to test support vector machine, svm, however due to the poor accuracy, the team decided to drop this.
